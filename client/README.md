# Create React App Boilerplate
This project is based on the
[Node API and Client Boilerplate](https://github.com/anthub-services/node-api-and-client-boilerplate).
Required node version is `9.11.2`.
The client app is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
and [Bootstrap 3.3](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) framework and theme.

## Settings

### Environment Vars

Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and change the values of the environment variables if needed.

```
REACT_APP_SITE_NAME=React App Boilerplate
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7770
REACT_APP_API_SIGN_IN_URL=http://localhost:7770/sign-in
REACT_APP_API_SIGN_OUT_URL=http://localhost:7770/sign-out
REACT_APP_API_VERIFY_TOKEN_URL=http://localhost:7770/verify-token
REACT_APP_API_SESSIONS_URL=http://localhost:7770/sessions
REACT_APP_API_USERS_URL=http://localhost:7770/users
REACT_APP_HASH=sha1hash1.sha1hash2.sha1hash3
```

NOTE: Generate random hashes and concatenate the hashes with “.”.
The same hashes should also be used in the API app.
The more hashes, the better.

### Config Files

Copy `./src/Config.dist` folder to `Config` and change the configurations if needed.

## Starting the App

```
yarn
yarn start
```

Note: See **Bash Commands** section for Docker.

To generate the `./client/src/Assets/Styles/Style.css`,
open another terminal console then on the `root` directory of the project,
run the following command:

```
yarn run watch-css
```

The command above works only in Mac with the `fsevents` module installed.
Run the command below as an alternative:

```
yarn run build-css
```

Note: You must run the command above manually everytime you made changes to `.scss` files.
All the `*.scss` files shall be compiled to `*.css` but only the `Style.css` is included in the repository.

Access the app at <http://localhost:7771>.

## Docker

Download and install the [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

Note: See **Bash Commands** section for Docker.

The `yarn run watch-css` command should be running on a separate terminal console for client app.

## Bash Commands

On the `root` directory of the project, run the following commands:

Note: To view the Docker containers, open another terminal console then enter `docker ps`.
