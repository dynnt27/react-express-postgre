# Node Express API Boilerplate
This project is based on the
[Node API and Client Boilerplate](https://github.com/anthub-services/node-api-and-client-boilerplate).
Required node version is `9.11.2`.
The API app is powered by [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
and used as API service for the [Create React App Boilerplate](https://github.com/anthub-services/create-react-app-boilerplate).

## Other API App Boilerplates

- [Node Express API Mockup Data Boilerplate](https://github.com/anthub-services/node-express-api-mockup-data-boilerplate) –
 non-database API server powered by [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Rails API Boilerplate](https://github.com/anthub-services/rails-api-boilerplate) –
 API server powered by [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database

## Starting the App

Note: Only change the environment variables for `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` if working on local machine.

Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and change the values of the environment variables if needed.

```
PORT=7770
ALLOW_ORIGIN=http://localhost:7771
JWT_SECRET=jwtsecretcode
HASH=sha1hash1.sha1hash2.sha1hash3
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=express_api_dev
POSTGRES_USER=express_api_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root
```

NOTE: Generate random hashes and concatenate the hashes with “.”.
The same hashes should also be used in the React client app.
The more hashes, the better.

Then run the following commands:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

Note: The database must be created and initialized after starting the app on fresh installation.
See **Database using PostgreSQL and Sequelize** section. See **Bash Commands** section for Docker.

Access the app at <http://localhost:7770>.

## Docker

Download and install the [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

Note: See **Bash Commands** section for Docker.

## Database using PostgreSQL and Sequelize

**Installing PostgreSQL**

**Mac:** [Getting Started with PostgreSQL on Mac OSX](https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb)
<br>
**Windows:** [Installing PostgreSQL, Creating a User, and Creating a Database](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF30/Database+Setup+for+PostgreSQL+on+Windows)

NOTE: For Mac users, you can run the PostgreSQL server on a separate terminal console by running the following command:

```
postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
```

**Create and Initialize Database**

Open a terminal console and run the following commands:

```
sequelize db:create
sequelize db:migrate
sequelize db:seed:all
```

To drop database, run the following command:

```
sequelize db:drop
```

See **Bash Commands** section for Docker.

## Bash Commands

On the `root` directory of the project, run the following commands:

Note: To view the Docker containers, open another terminal console then enter `docker ps`.
To manage separate Docker instance for API, open another terminal console and run the commands below.

### Docker

| Command                              | Description                                                        |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bin/install`                        | Build the Docker containers, initialise database and start the app |
| `bin/reinstall`                      | Re-build containers, re-initialise database and start the app      |
| `bin/start`                          | Start all the services (API and database)                          |
| `bin/stop`                           | Stop all the services                                              |
| `bin/console <container ID or Name>` | Access the terminal console of the API container                   |

### Database

**Local**

| Command                             | Description                                                |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bin/pg/local/start`                | Start the PostgreSQL server (for Mac users only)           |
| `bin/pg/local/resetdb`              | Drop and re-initialise database                            |
| `bin/pg/local/migrate`              | Run new schema migration                                   |

| `bin/pg/local/seed <seed file>`     | Run specific data seed file with or without .js extension  |
| `bin/pg/local/seedundo <seed file>` | Revert the seed of specific data seed file                 |
| `bin/pg/local/psql`                 | Access the database console                                |

**Docker**

- To run the commands for Docker database service, simply remove the `local` from the command
- The `start` command works only in local machine
- Used `bin/pg/psql <database container ID or Name>` to access the database console

## Users

Use the following credentials to test different API responses. Default password for all accounts is `password`.
